##Day 1

Built the title screen with 2 buttons. Got the "play" button to change backgrounds.
Still getting used to jQuery so things look rough but planning on smoothing things out as I go.

##Day 2

Researched how to make a countdown timer. Changed it to a regular timer that counts up so that it can represent the tama's age.
Found a free use sprite generator to make tama pets.
Was able to connect the timer so that it makes a tama pet hungry, sleepy, or bored.
Also wrote a function to "heal" the pet of it's hunger, sleepiness, or boredom. They aren't connected to a button yet so no way to activate them except hard coding it.

##Day 3

Figured out why buttons were not working when created with jQuery so now I have them created but hidden and I just make them visible when I need them.
Created the credits page with working buttons to go back to the title screen.

##Day 4
Spent a lot of time debugging and designing the pet selection screen.
Had trouble getting the user input for text and couldnt figure out how to get the pictures to be buttons

##Day 5

Got everything working. Used a radio input to turn the pictures into buttons with help of css and a lot of googling.
Fixed my progress bar issue.
Created a modal to be the game over screen and buttons to let you play again or go back to title screen.
