##Day 1

Built the title screen with 2 buttons. Got the "play" button to change backgrounds.
Still getting used to jQuery so things look rough but planning on smoothing things out as I go.

##Day 2

Researched how to make a countdown timer. Changed it to a regular timer that counts up so that it can represent the tama's age.
Found a free use sprite generator to make tama pets.
